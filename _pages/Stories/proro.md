# Proro’s first camp

![Proro and friends](/assets/img/proro.png)

Proro the parrot Kyler the koala and Ethan the alligator. They planed to make a camp. Proro agreed but after a some time he started to get nerves thinking the place the food and other problems. He was so Bizzy that he forgot that it was the day it was his birthday. His friends were planning to make a surprise party in the camp. The next day as proro was packing his stuff he looked at his calendar he remembered that it was his birthday but he didn’t care. When he arrived his friends told him to put on a blindfold so he did when he was in the camp he opened the blindfold to see that his friends had thrown a party for him next time he wood try new things even if he felt nerves.

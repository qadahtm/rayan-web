A boy named Rayan he was a scientist, and one day he wanted to make a garden. In the garden their wood be three new plants. The next day he started in his garden. The first fruit he took the DNA of the mangosteen and putted it in an apple seed then planted it after 2 days the first seed spouted, he saw it then he planned to make the second fruit. he took DNA of the lime and putted it in a lemon seed and planted it. the next day he tried the first fruit it was scrumptious but sweet it was just delicious. He made the third which he took the spiciest foods and did his thing, after 3 days the second fruit was ready, he first blended it so he could get a little tangy taste, he got a little taste because he knew it was super sour when he tasted it, he immediately noticed the tangy and sour taste. Then he checked on the third fruit it was ready, he took it and blended it then crushed it intel it became powder. He opened a shop in which the wood sells all three fruits [after a few months] the scientist was back buy the way he actually got  lots of money. in the spring he saw a video about [when you Lazer a crystal in a pacific way the product is wow] so he tried it he bought the machine and got a crystal, and did it the product was actually wow so he built a duplicate machine and sold it after a few years he was rich he loved his job. he even got workers that sold planted and did other things to make it easier for him to learn more. Buy the way he also up graded his lab with the money he got from the shop. Though he was still 18 years old. Hers a little story about him you see when he was young, he had no friends but plenty of tormentorâ€™s that time he hated school but soon his mom figured he was the so smart that the other kids noticed that they were super jellies  time past and they discovered that he wood be a good friend and now he has his own friends.

Rayan also had a brother his name was Iyad he wanted to be a Docter he was still learning but Rayan was shiur that Iyad will be a great doctor actually Iyad was the smallest he was younger than Rayan by 6 years. The next day Rayan wanted to make his ink he knew he already had his shop and crated his fruits but he wanted to make his own ink so he blended all the skins of the three fruits and added water and oil the inks color was yellow it accidentally  fell when he picked the bottle of ink he saw it blush to magenta the next day he saw the ink black he 3d printed some pens slides the ink in and you got a pen he kept making jars of ink and printing pens and selling by the way every time Rayan learns something new he teaches his workers. after years and years Iyad accomplished his dream of becoming a Docter and the family lived happily ever after.
